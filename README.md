# foodCode

The Tasty Food project was among the projects that I implemented through an independent website. This work was for the benefit of an Emirati company.
I converted it into a software code so that the customers of the site can see the menu of the restaurant by

entering it on the site using the link so that you can see all the meals, items, drinks and delicious vegetable dishes.
The entire site has been programmed. If you want to book a table in the restaurant, contact us and 
we will attend you quickly, through 24/7 chat service, you must contact us

you can watch now at this link =>
